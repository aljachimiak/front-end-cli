What is this talk about?

Who is the audience?

Ugh - I already know things...

What is does "front-end" mean?
    Usually the part of a program you interact with
    On the Web, its the part of the program you see
    
Components of Front End
    Html
    JS
    CSS (imgs)
    
Demo(link to precooked first html page)

Back in the olden days:
    Dreamweaver
    FrontPage

current
    Maccaw
    
CMS
    Wordpress
    Drupal
    
    new hotness: Squarespace
    
Grab a theme and insert your content

Where does a front-end developer fit in here?
  develops the themes.
  
That means knowing html, js, css, but also knowing the laguage of your CMS.  Usually PHP (img)

If you're a front end developer that works on a web-app, you need to know parts of the language your app is in, and the templating language of that language.
Python -> Django -> Jinja2
Ruby -> Rails -> Embedded Ruby 
PHP -> Laravel -> Blade
Node -> ExpressJS -> Handlebars
C# -> MVC -> cshtml

CMS are now offere=ing decoupled templating

Limit ourselves to Html CSS and Javascript

Even with those limits front-end developers have gained many responsibilities
    Make it Responsive!
    Make it Fast!
    Make it Maintainable!
    
Responsible for Everything in the head.  And how it is retrieved.

What is this talk about:
    Boundries - Only html, css, and js.  We'll assume knowledge of the way you can cram together the backend language and the the big three
    Focus on what a dev actual does to produce code
