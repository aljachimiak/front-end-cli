Sass
    This really isn't about Sass...

What is Sass?
    Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets
    an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language.
    use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more
    
Easy to start
    cp your_styles.css your_styles.scss
    work because Sass is an extension of css
    
Criticism
    Sass needs to be compiled out to a css file
    Uneccesary complication
    
Why use Sass?
    Nesting - DRY Styles
    Extends - http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#extend
    Variables
    Functions
    
Remember
    This really isn't about Sass...
    
Demo 
    Sass Nesting
    .scss in editor
    .css in inspector

    Sass Functions
    
This really isn't about Sass...
    This is really about the build process.
    
Compiling .scss -> .css is one of many different tasks that can be automated.
    Remember img?
    Expanding responsiblities related to maintainability, page size, page performance
    
The next slide is JAM-PACKED with a lot of info.
    Each of these tasks deserves 15 - 45 min.

Other modern build tasks
    create svg sprite sheets
    convert svg -> png
    gulp resize img (picture elem)
    prefix css
    
    minify css and js
    concatenate js
    tree shaking
    critical css

How are builds managed in the front-end workflow?
    Task runners
    Grunt
    Gulp

What is the difference?
    Grunt - Uses files and I/O operations to build final assets
    Gulp - Uses Node Strams to handle inermediary steps before outputting assets

Take a look at two different options.
    same tasks...
    handled in grunt and gulp
    found examples here: http://jaysoo.ca/2014/01/27/gruntjs-vs-gulpjs/ Jack Hsu
    
Note:
    $ make looks for a makefile to define processes
    
gruntfile.js
grunt.initConfig({
  sass: {
    dist: {
      files: [{
        cwd: 'app/styles',
        src: '**/*.scss',
        dest: '../.tmp/styles',
        expand: true,
        ext: '.css'
      }]
    }
  },
  autoprefixer: {
    options: ['last 1 version'],
    dist: {
      files: [{
        expand: true,
        cwd: '.tmp/styles',
        src: '{,*/}*.css',
        dest: 'dist/styles'
      }]
    }
  },
  watch: {
    styles: {
      files: ['app/styles/{,*/}*.scss'],
      tasks: ['sass:dist', 'autoprefixer:dist']
    }
  }
});
grunt.registerTask('default', ['styles', 'watch']);

gulpfile.js
gulp.task('sass', function () {
  gulp.src('app/styles/**/*.scss')
    .pipe(sass())
    .pipe(autoprefixer('last 1 version'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/styles'));
});
gulp.task('default', function() {
  gulp.run('sass');
  gulp.watch('app/styles/**/*.scss', function() {
    gulp.run('sass');
  });
});

Nerd img    
    "Why are you using gulp instead of grunt?"
    
Gulp happens to be newer and is what all the cool kids are using
