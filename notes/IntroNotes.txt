What I do everyday...

What I do on *real* web projects...

What is this talk about?

Who is the audience?
    "I do front-end things, but the command line is intimidating"
    "I don't do front-end things, and why the hell would they need anything other than git and a text editor"

Ugh - I already know things...

What is does "front-end" mean?
    Usually the part of a program you interact with
    On the Web, its the part of the program you see
    
Components of Front End
    Html
    JS
    CSS (imgs)
    
    
Demo(link to precooked first html page)

Back in the olden days:
    Dreamweaver
    FrontPage

current
    Maccaw

-> Expanding Front-End Responsibilities
    
CMS
    Wordpress
    Drupal
    
    new hotness: Squarespace
    
    Grab a theme and insert your content

Where does a front-end developer fit in for a CMS here?
  develops the themes.
  
That means knowing html, js, css, but also knowing the laguage of your CMS.  Usually PHP (img)

-> If you're a front end developer that works on a web-app, you need to know parts of the language your app is in, and the templating language of that language.
table
Python -> Django -> Jinja2
Ruby -> Rails -> Embedded Ruby 
PHP -> Laravel -> Blade
Node -> ExpressJS -> Handlebars
C# -> MVC -> cshtml

CMS are now offere=ing decoupled templating

-> Because landscape is vast we'll narrow the scope a bit
    Limit ourselves to Html CSS and Javascript
    everything in the head.  And how it is retrieved.
    everything rendered in the body

Even with those limits front-end developers have gained many responsibilities
    Make it Responsive!
    Make it Fast!
    Make it Maintainable!
    


What is this talk about:
    Boundries - Only html, css, and js.  We'll assume knowledge of the way you can cram together the backend language and the the big three
    Focus on what a dev actual does to produce code
